Update README.md and docs/ to reflect current behaviour. Keep docs/ end-user focused (no links to ADRs, SCOPE, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, or other planning docs). Include clear, actionable guidance for real end-user workflows (including deployment and compliance responsibilities where users are the audience), but keep deep technical implementation details and decision rationale in plan/ for developers. Do not add features that do not exist. Use UK English spelling and terminology.
