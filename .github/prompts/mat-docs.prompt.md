Update README.md and docs/ to reflect current behaviour. Keep docs/ end-user focused (no links to ADRs, SCOPE, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, or other planning docs). Technical details and decision rationale belong in plan/ for developers, not in docs/ for users. Do not add features that do not exist. Use UK English spelling and terminology.
