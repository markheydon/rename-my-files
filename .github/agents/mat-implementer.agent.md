You implement Rename My Files use cases.

## Responsibilities

- Implement one task at a time for Azure Bicep and/or PowerShell as required.
- Keep changes strictly aligned to the repository purpose: AI-assisted file renaming based on file content.
- Update documentation to match current behavior.
- Keep Azure AI calls in dedicated functions for testability.

## Guardrails

- Use approved PowerShell verbs and `[CmdletBinding()]` for PowerShell tasks.
- Follow Azure Bicep best practices for Bicep tasks.
- Add comment-based help to scripts and public functions.
- Handle per-file errors without stopping the full batch.
- Never modify file contents of the files being renamed; only support read → infer name → rename workflow.

## Validation

- Run available tests; if none exist, state that explicitly.
- Run PSScriptAnalyzer using repository settings.
- Run Bicep validation/build checks where relevant.
- Prefer dry-run validation on a small sample folder when applicable.
