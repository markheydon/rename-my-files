# Implementation Plan

This plan breaks work into small, testable tasks. Update it when the code changes.

## Current State Snapshot

**MVP Status:** ✅ **Complete** — All phases 0–5 are finished. Core features are functional and documented.

### What Works Now

- Scripts run locally with PowerShell 7; cross-platform ready (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- `Rename-MyFiles.ps1`
  - Reads plain-text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.yaml`, etc.)
  - Uses Azure OpenAI REST API directly for filename proposals.
  - Implements dry-run via `ShouldProcess` with `-WhatIf` support.
  - Handles per-file errors without stopping the batch.
  - Sanitises filenames (removes invalid chars, control chars, collapses spaces, handles collisions).
  - Truncates filenames to Windows limits (255 chars).
  - Makes Windows reserved names safe (e.g., `CON` → `CON_file`).
  - Limits content sent to Azure AI to 8000 characters.
  - Prints summary of renamed/skipped/failed counts.
- `Deploy-RenameMyFiles.ps1`
  - Uses Azure CLI (`az`) with built-in Bicep support (no separate installation).
  - Creates resource group, Azure OpenAI resource, and GPT-4o mini deployment.
  - Automates soft-deleted resource restoration via `restore: true` property.
- `Remove-RenameMyFilesResources.ps1`
  - Uses Azure CLI (`az`) for safe resource group deletion.
  - Prompts for confirmation; supports `–Force` flag.
- All documentation (README, user guide, runbook) updated to reflect current behaviour and limitations.
- Architecture decisions documented in `DECISIONS/` (ADR-0002, ADR-0003, ADR-0004).

### Known Limitations (MVP)

- **Plain-text files:** Fully supported (text extraction works).
- **PDF files:** Use filename context only (no text extraction yet). See Phase 6.
- **Office documents (`.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`):** Use filename context only (no text extraction yet). See Phase 6.
- **Image formats (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.webp`):** Skipped automatically (no OCR/vision support in MVP).
- **Other unsupported file types (binary, archives, executables, media):** Skipped automatically.
- **Subfolder recursion:** Not supported; only top-level files processed.
- **AI-generated names are suggestions:** May not always be perfect; always preview with `-WhatIf` first.

## Phase 0 - Cross-Platform Azure Tooling Migration

## Phase 1 - Baseline Verification

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

**Objective:** Ensure core script structure meets MVP requirements.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Verify the README and docs refer to `scripts/` paths.
- [x] Confirm `Rename-MyFiles.ps1` uses `ShouldProcess` for dry-run.
- [x] Confirm Azure OpenAI calls are isolated in a dedicated function (`Invoke-AzureOpenAIFilenameProposal`).

## Phase 2 - File Intake and Safety

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

**Objective:** Ensure robust input handling and error resilience.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Validate folder path input with `[ValidateScript()]` attribute.
- [x] Handle missing or empty folders gracefully (output message, exit cleanly).
- [x] Confirm only top-level files are processed via `Get-ChildItem -File` (no recursion).
- [x] Ensure per-file error handling does not stop the batch (catch and log, continue loop).

## Phase 3 - Content Extraction

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

**Objective:** Implement MVP content extraction with size limits and placeholder support.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Support plain-text file extraction (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.yaml`).
- [x] Add 8000-character limit (approx. 2000 tokens) before sending to Azure OpenAI.
- [x] Implement placeholder extraction for PDF files (returns `[PDF file: <filename>]`).
  - Code location: [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1#L93-L101) lines 93–101.
  - Rationale: Real PDF text extraction deferred to Phase 6 (post-MVP).
- [x] Implement placeholder extraction for Office documents (returns `[Office document: <filename>]`).
  - Code location: [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1#L104-L107) lines 104–107.
  - Rationale: Real Office text extraction deferred to Phase 6 (post-MVP).

**Note:** Placeholder extraction allows all file types to get best-effort renames based on filename context. Real PDF/Office extraction is a post-MVP enhancement; see Phase 6.

## Phase 4 - AI Naming and Sanitisation

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

**Objective:** Ensure proposed filenames are safe, valid, and non-colliding.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Azure OpenAI prompt designed to produce valid Windows filenames (no `\\ / : * ? \" < > |` chars).
  - Code location: [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1#L129-L150) lines 129–150.
- [x] Remove invalid Windows characters (`\\ / : * ? \" < > |`) from AI-proposed names.
- [x] Remove control characters (ASCII < 32) to prevent hidden/invalid bytes.
- [x] Normalise whitespace (collapse tabs, newlines, multiple spaces to single space).
- [x] Collapse consecutive dashes (e.g., `--` → `-`).
- [x] Trim leading/trailing spaces and dots.
- [x] Handle Windows reserved names (e.g., `CON`, `PRN`, `COM1`) by appending `_file`.
- [x] Truncate to 255 characters (Windows filename limit).
- [x] Resolve collisions without overwriting: append `-1`, `-2`, etc., until unique path found.
  - Code location: [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1#L231-L248) lines 231–248 (Resolve-UniqueFilePath).

## Phase 5 - Reporting and Documentation

  - [x] Create [DECISIONS/ADR-0004-restore-soft-deleted-resources.md](DECISIONS/ADR-0004-restore-soft-deleted-resources.md) — soft-delete handling strategy and manual purge instructions.

#### Troubleshooting & Operational Guidance
- [x] Document soft-deleted resource troubleshooting in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) (soft-delete retention, manual purge steps).
- [x] Document data residency and processing location implications in user-guide.md.

## Phase 6 - Enhanced Content Extraction

**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started** (Post-MVP Backlog)

**Objective:** Replace placeholder extraction logic with real text extraction for PDF and Office documents, improving AI-generated filename quality.

### Why Post-MVP?

- Current placeholder extraction (filename context) allows all file types to receive best-effort renames.
- Real text extraction requires new dependencies, cross-platform testing, and error handling.
- MVP scope ([SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md)) does not mandate PDF/Office text support; plain-text only is MVP.
- Deferring to Phase 6 allows MVP release with stable, minimal dependencies.

### Phase 6a - PDF Text Extraction

**Priority:** High (most common document type after plain text)

#### Task: Research & Select PDF Extraction Method
- [ ] Investigate PDF extraction options:
  - **PdfPig** (.NET library, approx. 500 KB, MIT licensed, cross-platform via .NET Core/Framework).
  - **pdftotext** (external utility, requires installation and PATH setup).
  - **iTextSharp** (.NET library, commercial license considerations).
  - **Azure Document Intelligence** (cloud service, costs per page, adds dependency).
- [ ] Evaluation criteria:
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - Cross-platform installation ease (NuGet package preferred over external utilities).
  - Licensing (no proprietary/expensive licenses).
  - Error handling (malformed/encrypted PDFs fall back gracefully).
  - Size (minimal impact on script distribution).
- [ ] Document recommendation and rationale in [DECISIONS/ADR-000X-pdf-extraction.md](DECISIONS/) (future ADR).

#### Task: Implement PDF Text Extraction
- [ ] Modify `Get-FileTextContent` function in [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1) (lines 93–101).
  - Replace placeholder logic returning `[PDF file: <filename>]` with real extraction.
  - Extract up to 8000 characters (existing limit).
  - Handle unsupported/encrypted/malformed PDFs by catching errors and falling back to filename context.
  - Return extracted text or placeholder, never throw.
- [ ] Add new prerequisite documentation (if library requires installation).
  - Specify exact NuGet package version or external utility version.
  - Document installation steps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [ ] Test with realistic PDF samples:
  - Text-based PDF (e.g., Office document exported to PDF).
  - Scanned PDF (image-based, text extraction may fail — fallback to context).
  - Encrypted/password-protected PDF (decryption not required; fallback to context).
  - Malformed/corrupted PDF (invalid header; fallback to context).
- [ ] Update user-guide.md to list PDF extraction under supported file types.
  - Note any limitations (e.g., scanned PDFs, encrypted PDFs use context).

### Phase 6b - Office Document Text Extraction

**Priority:** Medium (frequently renamed, multiple formats)

#### Task: Research & Select Office Extraction Method
- [ ] Investigate Office document extraction options:
  - **DocumentFormat.OpenXml** (.NET library, Microsoft-supported, cross-platform via .NET Core/Framework).
  - **OpenXML SDK** (similar to above, official Microsoft library).
  - **LibreOffice CLI** (`soffice` command-line, external utility, cross-platform).
  - **Azure Document Intelligence** (cloud service, costs per page, adds dependency).
- [ ] Evaluation criteria:
  - Format coverage (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx minimum; .doc, .xls, .ppt optional).
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - Installation ease (NuGet preferred over external utilities).
  - Licensing (open source or permissive).
  - Error handling (corrupted/password-protected documents handled gracefully).
- [ ] Document recommendation and rationale in [DECISIONS/ADR-000X-office-extraction.md](DECISIONS/) (future ADR).

#### Task: Implement Office Document Text Extraction
- [ ] Modify `Get-FileTextContent` function in [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1) (lines 104–107).
  - Replace placeholder logic returning `[Office document: <filename>]` with real extraction.
  - Support at minimum: `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`.
  - Extract up to 8000 characters from first sheet/slide (existing limit).
  - Handle corrupted/password-protected/unsupported formats by catching errors and falling back to filename context.
  - Return extracted text or placeholder, never throw.
- [ ] Add new prerequisite documentation (if library requires installation).
  - Specify exact NuGet package version or external utility version.
  - Document installation steps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [ ] Test with realistic Office document samples:
  - `.docx` file (modern Word format).
  - `.xlsx` file with multiple sheets (extract from first sheet).
  - `.pptx` file with multiple slides (extract from first slide).
  - Password-protected `.docx` (fallback to context).
  - Corrupted/malformed file (fallback to context).
- [ ] Update user-guide.md to list Office document extraction under supported file types.
  - Note format support (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.).
  - Note limitations (password-protected, corrupted, etc.).

### Phase 6c - Validation & Release

- [ ] Test cross-platform behaviour:
  - Windows (native .NET on Windows or .NET Core).
  - macOS (.NET Core / .NET 5+).
  - Linux (.NET Core / .NET 5+).
- [ ] Confirm error handling does not break batch processing:
  - Run with mixed file types (plain text, PDF, Office, unsupported).
  - Verify all files attempt rename; no exceptions bubble up.
  - Verify summary accurate (renamed/skipped counts correct).
- [ ] Run linting and validation:
  - PSScriptAnalyzer: `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path .\scripts -Settings .\PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1 -Recurse`
  - Bicep build (if dependencies require Bicep changes): `az bicep build --file infra/main.bicep`
- [ ] Update [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) to mark Phase 6 complete.
- [ ] Update [README.md](README.md) **Current Limitations** section to reflect new extraction capabilities.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope — Not Planned)

These features are documented as potential future work but are **not in scope** per [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md):

- **Recursive subfolder processing** — Current design processes only top-level files to keep behaviour straightforward. Could be added as a flag (e.g., `-Recurse`) in a future version.
- **Batch capacity optimisation** — Scale to 10,000+ files by increasing Azure OpenAI TPM (tokens per minute) quota. Requires quota adjustments and batching logic.
- **Alternative AI backends** — Currently Azure OpenAI only. Other providers (OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, etc.) could be added, but would require new integration code and testing.
- **GUI or web interface** — Current CLI approach is lightweight and cross-platform. A GUI could improve UX for non-technical users but adds complexity and platform-specific dependencies.
- **File content modification** — Explicitly out of scope. This tool **only renames**; it never edits file contents.

## Assumptions & Design Decisions

### Current Implementation (MVP, Phases 0–5)

- **No automated tests:** Validation is manual (dry-run testing, visual inspection). Test harness to be added in future if needed.
- **Azure OpenAI only:** Single AI backend simplifies code and deployment. Alternative providers deferred to post-MVP.
- **Credential passing:** Users supply credentials via environment variables (`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`) or script parameters for flexibility.
- **PowerShell 7.2+:** Required for cross-platform support (`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`). Tested on Windows; untested on macOS/Linux but theoretically compatible.
- **Azure CLI (az):** Must be installed; verified at script runtime via `Get-Command az`.
- **Bicep built-in:** Azure CLI includes Bicep compiler; no separate installation needed.
- **Soft-delete handling:** Bicep property `restore: true` automatically restores recently soft-deleted Azure OpenAI resources during redeployment.
- **GlobalStandard deployment:** Data may be processed in any Azure region; stricter alternatives (DataZoneStandard, Regional Standard) available at higher cost (documented in ADR-0003).
- **Plain-text extraction only:** MVP supports `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.yaml`, `.yml`. PDF and Office use filename context only (Phase 6).

### Phase 6 Assumptions (Post-MVP Enhancement)

- **Cross-platform extraction:** PDF and Office extraction must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux without commercial licenses (rules out COM-based Excel, Word APIs).
- **Library preference:** Favour .NET libraries (via NuGet) over external CLI utilities for better portability and consistency.
- **Graceful degradation:** If extraction fails (malformed, encrypted, unsupported format), fall back to filename context rather than skip the file.
- **8000-character limit:** Maintain existing truncation for remaining phases to control Azure OpenAI token usage and costs.
- **No new mandatory dependencies:** If Phase 6 introduces dependencies, they should be optional or installable via standard package managers (NuGet, Homebrew, apt) without commercial licensing overhead.

## Phase 7 - Image Support Feasibility (Out of Scope Validation)

**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

**Objective:** Validate whether image files should remain out of scope or move into a future scope update with explicit OCR/vision trade-offs.

### Planned Tasks

- [ ] Document current behaviour in code and docs as a baseline.
  - [ ] Confirm `Get-FileTextContent` returns `$null` for image formats in [scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1](scripts/Rename-MyFiles.ps1).
  - [ ] Ensure docs state image formats are skipped in MVP.
- [ ] Evaluate two implementation paths (research only; no code changes):
  - [ ] **OCR path:** Extract text from images first, then use existing filename prompt flow.
  - [ ] **Vision path:** Send image content to a multimodal model for direct filename proposals.
- [ ] Capture cost and operational implications for both paths.
  - [ ] Estimate per-image token/processing cost impact vs plain text.
  - [ ] Note latency impact and likely throughput reduction for large batches.
  - [ ] Note privacy implications for sending image pixels vs extracted text.
- [ ] Record decision in a future ADR and update [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) only if image support is approved.

### Why This Phase Exists

- [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) currently defines image understanding as out of scope for MVP.
- This phase prevents accidental scope expansion while still keeping a testable decision trail.
- Image support is not equivalent to current PDF placeholder behaviour; it requires OCR or multimodal processing.

**Assumption:** Until scope changes are explicitly approved, image files remain intentionally unsupported and skipped.
